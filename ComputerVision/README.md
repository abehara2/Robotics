Locate square blocks using filtering and simple blob detector. Transform image coordinates to world coordinates and perform
pick and place task from world coordinates to the goal position. Calculate the Inverse Kinematics to find the desired orientation for each joint and use the Forward Kinematics to verify correctness. OpenCV, ROS, Gazebo, UR3 simulation platform.
